# Facial Emotion Recognition Project
## Overview
This project aims to develop a facial emotion recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze facial expressions in images and predict the corresponding emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

## Technologies Used
* TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks.
* Keras: High-level neural networks API built on top of TensorFlow, used for defining and training deep learning models.
* ResNet50: Pre-trained convolutional neural network architecture utilized for feature extraction and transfer learning.
* VGGFace: Pre-trained deep learning model designed for face recognition tasks.
* Matplotlib: Python plotting library used for visualizing data and results.
* NumPy: Numerical computing library used for efficient array operations and data manipulation.
